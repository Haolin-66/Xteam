I have no idea about linux
Linux is too complicated to use
But I like it
I don't really like it, it is confused. Hopefully I can be skilled at the
 end of this semester

By the end of the semester, we will all have a greater understanding of how 
linux works.  Especially after all of these assignments using linux and git.

Now to the story:
Once there was a student who never did their homework. Resultantly, the student's grades
were dropping.
